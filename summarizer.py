# --- Extractive Text Summarizer using spaCy ---
# This script summarizes a long piece of text by identifying the most important sentences.
# It works by calculating the frequency of each word and then scoring each sentence
# based on the importance of the words it contains.

# Step 1: Install necessary libraries
# In your terminal, run the following commands:
# pip install spacy
# python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

import spacy
from spacy.lang.en.stop_words import STOP_WORDS
from string import punctuation

    Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. 
    Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. 
    Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is often used to describe machines that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving".
    As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. 
    A quip in Tesler's Theorem says "AI is whatever hasn't been done yet." For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology. 
    Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech, competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go), autonomously operating cars, and intelligent routing in content delivery networks and military simulations.
